11-Oct-2020; 16:57 | Copied my own cheatsheet to this repo. About to attempt a longform ~git pull~ because the manual says "More precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and calls git merge to merge teh retrieved branch heads into the current branch. With --rebase, it runs git rebase instead of git merge." So... next order of business is to find out what ~git rebase~ is all about.
