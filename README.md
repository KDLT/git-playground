# Git Playground
## A place where I can break shit and try to fix them

This is my local git playground. Maybe I'll push it to github, maybe not...
    Clearly I pushed it so here it is.

## Adventure Log
 11-Oct-2020
| --- | --- |
| Time  |   Description |
| 16:35 |   This file is created in github. Checking if this will successfully get pulled to my local repo. |
| 16:45 |   This edit is done in the local machine which is then ~pushed~ to the remote in github using ~git push origin master~|
| 16:57 | Copied my own cheatsheet to this repo. About to attempt a longform ~git pull~ because the manual says "More precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and calls git merge to merge teh retrieved branch heads into the current branch. With --rebase, it runs git rebase instead of git merge." So... next order of business is to find out what ~git rebase~ is all about. |
| 17:06 | Updated the README so it would contain the more verbose log that my commit messages supposedly are. Trying my hand on making tables in markdown, too because I haven't tried this before. |
| 17:27 | Can't make a proper table to save my life. Trying if this gets drawn properly. Also trying to push both the old local branch named ~feature0\_again~ and making a new branch called ~markdown~ where I can experiment with markdown before mergin it to the README.md because I can't follow simple syntax. |
| 17:31 | This edit lives in the branch named markdown, pushing this to remote next. |
